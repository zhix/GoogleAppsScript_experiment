# GoogleAppsScript_experiment

This is a repo to document all the cool functions we built on Google Apps Script, including: 

## [Connecting to Airtable API](https://github.com/zhix/GoogleAppsScript_experiment/blob/master/airtable.gs)
1) Objective: to access, view, and update the data on [Airtable](http://airtable.com/). 

## [Trigger IFTTT Webhooks](https://github.com/zhix/GoogleAppsScript_experiment/blob/master/airtable.gs)
1) Objective: when a button on GDoc/Sheet is pressed, a Maker Event will be triggered. 
2) Before using it, make sure you have set up [IFTTT Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) 

In this example we test it with Phone Notification as response:
